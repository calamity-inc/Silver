# silver.css

A dead-simple CSS framework made for dark mode.

## Usage

```HTML
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://calamity.gg/silver.css">
```

## Builtin components/classes

- `slv-container`
- `slv-sleeve`
- `slv-loader`
- `slv-hidden`

## Config

By default, Silver shows a warning when Dark Reader is enabled since it has no considerations for websites already being in dark mode. You can disable this by adding the `slv-ignore-darkreader` class to your `body` tag.
